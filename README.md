Model for Predicting Housing Prices


# Description
The purpose of this project is to build a model of housing prices in California using the California census data. This data has features such as population, median income, median housing price and so on for each district in California.

The model would learn from the data and be able to predict the median housing price in any district, given all other attributes.

The CRISP-DM framework was used and the project was split according to the 6 phases of the framework:  
1. Business Understanding
2. Data Understanding
3. Data Preparation
4. Modeling 
5. Evaluation
6. Deployment
